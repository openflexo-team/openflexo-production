# HowTo: Create a new installable distribution of Openflexo softwares =

Openflexo provides tools to package software distribution including a full set of Openflexo components.

Those tools can also be used to build installers for several platforms: iOS, linux, Windows

Here we use  
* ''distro project''
* ''current project'' 

Why? Because it is possible to create a pure ''distro project'' that does not contain any addition resource or source file, or
to configure any ''current project'' so that it can be packaged and distributed as a set of autonomous installers (one per target platform).


## Step by step: configure a project to build an new installable distribution

## Files needed in the project

### Files that drive the build & packaging process
* pom.xml => the maven project file that also contains information about the standard build process
* build-packaging.xml => the 'ant' tooling that provides the customization for the 
* packaging.xml => this file contains the parameters for the packaging (jar, zip,...) of the current project
* packaging.properties
	* versionType=Tests
	* productSuffix=TestApplication
	* productDescription=A test application
	* Copyright=Openflexo
	* icon_mac_name=IconOpenflexo.icns
	* userType=developer_release
	* allowsDocSubmission=false
	* logCount=0
	* keepLogTrace=false
..* default.logging.level=SEVERE
..* maven.artifact.id=packaging-tests
..* maven.group.id=org.openflexo
..* wizard.setup.icon=Openflexo.ico
..* launcher.splash=SplashPanel.bmp
..* vm.args=-Xmx512M -XX:MaxPermSize=128M

### Resources needed for the installers & splash screen generation

Those files need to be in the src/main/resources of the project.

* Icons:
..* ./Icons/IconOpenflexo.icns (icone pour mac)
..* ./Icons/Openflexo.ico (icone pour Windows)
..* ./Icons/SplashPanel.bmp (72x72 ppp en 128 couleurs index√©s 580x300 pixels max)
