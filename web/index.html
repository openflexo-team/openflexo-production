<h1>We will come back as soon as possible</h1>

The Openflexo company stopped its activity in April 2018.

IMT Atlantique PASS research team and an association of openflexo users are working on bringing back all the services that were available on this address:
<ul>
<li>The web site with the documentation</li>
<li>The artifactory for the software packages</li>
<li>The JIRA for all openflexo related bugs and enhancement requests</li>
<li>The jenkins and the prepackaged versions of the software</li>
<li>The email addresses openflexo.org</li>
</ul>

During the downtime, the source code is still available at <a href="https://github.com/openflexo-team/" >https://github.com/openflexo-team/</a>.
